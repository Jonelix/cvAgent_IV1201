### Code writing
**Coding**
When it comes to coding we follow:
- Variables & Methods: camelCasing
- Files: PascalCasing
**Documentation**
Here is a example of how to document a method or object. 
>```
>/**
> \* Adds two numbers and returns the result.
> \* @param {number} a - The first number.
> \* @param {number} b - The second number.
> \* @returns {number} - The sum of a and b.
> */
>function add(a, b) {
>    return a + b;
>}
>```

### Consistent GUI components
Header, footer and main body. Why?

### Canvas Links
**Vite** - Uploaded
